# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
As we know, many people are eager to lose their weight by trying to go on a diet or exercise hard.But many have failed.Our goal is to find out how many pounds a person loses.
Suppose we set this person a goal of a fixed amount of calories that he or she should burn in a day.To achieve this goal, the person needs to control what he or she eat ,and keep exercising.The calories taken in is one of the parameters.Calories that are burned are affected by BMR ,which is related to the personâ€™s sex ,age and career ,and what kind of exercise he or she does.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty:
sex ;age ;current weight ;calorie intake ;career : static ,medium ,dynamic ;exercise : cardio ,anaerobic ,mixed.

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
No hypothesis.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
